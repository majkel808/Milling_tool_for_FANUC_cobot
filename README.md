## Detaild description

The professor at my university proposed a scientific project involving the utilization of a robotic arm within the medical field. The primary objective was to enable the robot to control a milling tool, followed by the development of a program to machine parts in three-dimensional space. I was recommended for the task of designing the tool.

The project's goal was to create an optimal geometric design for mounting the milling toolhead on the 6-axis robotic arm. This involved sourcing suitable parts and subsequently designing the entire tool assembly.

## 3D modeling of the tool

I utilized Autodesk Inventor software to design the tool, with most components being manufactured using 3D printing. However, for structural rigidity, a crucial part was crafted from aluminum. It was essential to consider the angular position of the toolhead to facilitate the software in avoiding singularities of the robot arm. Therefore, I opted to position the milling tool at a 45-degree angle. Following the construction of the tool, despite being created through 3D printing, I measured that the tool was at a 44.97-degree angle.

## Mounting the tool on the robot

After assembling the tool, it was seamlessly integrated onto the robotic arm, culminating in the final assembly depicted in the images below.
